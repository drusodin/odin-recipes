# odin-recipes

In this project, I will create a simple website using HTML. This website will contain an index.html page which links to other recipe pages that I will also create.

I will demonstrate the ability to create my folder/file structure (using the command line) and add HTML content to my webpages. I will also practice version control and familiarize myself with Git.

Good luck. Look back on me fondly, future Dru. Don't stop trucking along my friend.
