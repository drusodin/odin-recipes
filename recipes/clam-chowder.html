    <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>Shouts out to The Cozy Cook (https://thecozycook.com/clam-chowder-recipe/) I'm functionally plagiarizing her recipe page because I am choosing to use my mental resources for HTML and not recipe blogging at this very moment. Her recipe was the first clam chowder recipe that popped up. God bless you Stephanie. I will make this recipe in your honor...one day.</p>
        <p>I am a New England native, so it is my honor and privilege to present this incredible, <strong>restaurant-worthy</strong> clam chowder to you. If you’re new to this recipe, don’t worry. <strong>The process is simple.</strong> (I <em>promise!</em>)</p>

        <p>I’ve outlined how to use <strong>fresh OR canned clams</strong> in this recipe, and I swear- the canned clam version is great. Using canned clams is not only super easy, but it allows you to put a plentiful amount of clams in the chowder without spending a ton of money.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 strips thick-cut bacon, can sub salt pork</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 ribs celery, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce, or ½ tsp tabasco sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>3 cups Half and Half</li>
            <li>8 oz. clam juice</li>
            <li>1 chicken bouillon cube</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 ¼ lbs. potatoes, see notes</li>
            <li>3 (6.5 oz. cans) chopped clams, juices reserved</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley & Freshly cracked pepper, for serving</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil and salt your a pot of water. I don't have measurements for this, you can freestyle it. There should be enough water that your pasta fits. Make it pretty salty. Not like ocean salty but maybe sweat salty...</li>
            <li>Add your pasta. Let it cook until it's got a bit of chew to it (around 10 min). AL dente as they say.</li>
            <li>Around the 5 min mark, start to heat milk/cream and butter over medium heat in a separate pot. Don't let this get too hot too fast or it will scorch. Treat it gentle, like you love it.</li>
            <li>Grate your parmesan into the sauce. Or pour straight in if you're going pre-grated. The cheese will thicken the milk sauce.</li>
            <li>Strain your pasta. Add strained pasta to the sauce. Mix it up until desired consistency. Add more cream/milk if needed. Remember it will thicken when it cools so it leave it a bit more watery than you'd like it when served.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add more parmesan over the top.</li>
        </ol>
