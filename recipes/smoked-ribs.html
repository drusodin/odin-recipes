    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shout outs to "How to BBQ Right" this time for the content. I do make some good smoked meats but gonna plagiarize again for the sake of moving forward with learning web dev. Recipe is from this guy's site: https://howtobbqright.com/2016/05/06/texas-style-ribs/</p>
        <p>With Texas Style Ribs it’s all about the meat and the smoke… and what seasonings they do use, they keep simple. And there is nothing wrong with simple</p>
