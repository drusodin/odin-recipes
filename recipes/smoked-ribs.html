    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shout outs to "How to BBQ Right" this time for the content. I do make some good smoked meats but gonna plagiarize again for the sake of moving forward with learning web dev. Recipe is from this guy's site: https://howtobbqright.com/2016/05/06/texas-style-ribs/</p>
        <p>With Texas Style Ribs it’s all about the meat and the smoke… and what seasonings they do use, they keep simple. And there is nothing wrong with simple</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 slabs St. Louis Spare Ribs</li>
            <li>½ cup Coarse Ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>1 cup Water</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil and salt your a pot of water. I don't have measurements for this, you can freestyle it. There should be enough water that your pasta fits. Make it pretty salty. Not like ocean salty but maybe sweat salty...</li>
            <li>Add your pasta. Let it cook until it's got a bit of chew to it (around 10 min). AL dente as they say.</li>
            <li>Around the 5 min mark, start to heat milk/cream and butter over medium heat in a separate pot. Don't let this get too hot too fast or it will scorch. Treat it gentle, like you love it.</li>
            <li>Grate your parmesan into the sauce. Or pour straight in if you're going pre-grated. The cheese will thicken the milk sauce.</li>
            <li>Strain your pasta. Add strained pasta to the sauce. Mix it up until desired consistency. Add more cream/milk if needed. Remember it will thicken when it cools so it leave it a bit more watery than you'd like it when served.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add more parmesan over the top.</li>
        </ol>
