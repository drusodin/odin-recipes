    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my go-to pasta recipes. It's quick, easy to make, and tastes absolutely fire. There's only a few ingredients, stuff many Americans would have laying around. I recommend going for a quality cheese, but no shame if all you have is that powdery Kraft stuff in the shaker bottle. It will get the job done!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>90 g Dried pasta (Spaghetti recommended)</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Whole Milk or Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
            <li>As much Parmesan cheese as your heart desires</li>
            <li>14 g (1 tbsp) Salted Butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil and salt your a pot of water. I don't have measurements for this, just freestyle it. There should be enough water that your pasta fits. Make it pretty salty. Not like ocean salty but maybe sweat salty...</li>
