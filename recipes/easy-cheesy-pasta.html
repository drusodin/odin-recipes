    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my go-to pasta recipes. It's quick, easy to make, and tastes absolutely fire. There's only a few ingredients, stuff many Americans would have laying around. I recommend going for a quality cheese, but no shame if all you have is that powdery Kraft stuff in the shaker bottle. It will get the job done!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>90 g Dried pasta (Spaghetti recommended)</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Whole Milk or Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
            <li>As much Parmesan cheese as your heart desires</li>
            <li>14 g (1 tbsp) Salted Butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil and salt your a pot of water. I don't have measurements for this, you can freestyle it. There should be enough water that your pasta fits. Make it pretty salty. Not like ocean salty but maybe sweat salty...</li>
            <li>Add your pasta. Let it cook until it's got a bit of chew to it (around 10 min). AL dente as they say.</li>
            <li>Around the 5 min mark, start to heat milk/cream and butter over medium heat in a separate pot. Don't let this get too hot too fast or it will scorch. Treat it gentle, like you love it.</li>
            <li>Grate your parmesan into the sauce. Or pour straight in if you're going pre-grated. The cheese will thicken the milk sauce.</li>
            <li>Strain your pasta. Add strained pasta to the sauce. Mix it up until desired consistency. Add more cream/milk if needed. Remember it will thicken when it cools so it leave it a bit more watery than you'd like it when served.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add more parmesan over the top.</li>
        </ol>
