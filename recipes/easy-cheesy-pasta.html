    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my go-to pasta recipes. It's quick, easy to make, and tastes absolutely fire. There's only a few ingredients, stuff many Americans would have laying around. I recommend going for a quality cheese, but no shame if all you have is that powdery Kraft stuff in the shaker bottle. It will get the job done!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>90 g Dried pasta (Spaghetti recommended)</ul>
        <ul>1/2 Cup Whole Milk or Heavy Whipping Cream</ul>
        <ul>As much Parmesan cheese as your heart desires</ul>
        <ul>14 g (1 tbsp) Salted Butter</ul>
        <ul>Salt and pepper</ul>
